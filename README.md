# Project-Adidas-sales
 The Covid-19 pandemic led to economic depression but also spurred new sales methods and shifts in consumption. This project examines Adidas customers' consumption changes during the pandemic. The results will aid in analyzing the company's future market strategies and plans for expanding information and projecting sales.

# Description
This work conducts a descriptive operational analysis of data using interactive dashboards from the selected database. It is aimed at an audience capable of interacting with the dashboard and drawing their own conclusions. It presents projected economic indicators based on sales levels during specific periods and displays the distribution of sales by geography, sales channels, and the types and proportions of products sold.

# Work Development:
An individual analysis of variables was conducted to address the objective questions, each on separate worksheets. Then, two descriptive and interactive dashboards were created to guide the target audience in drawing their own conclusions.

# Conclusions
There were fewer sales of female products compared to male products during the analyzed 2020-2021 period. Specifically, the least sold product was women's athletic footwear.
Additionally, the sales method that generated the fewest sales was the outlet. The retailers with the lowest sales of women's athletic footwear were Walmart and Amazon.
From April to July, there was a noticeable decrease in sales, and the geographical area with the lowest sales was the Midwest region of the country.
The analysis is significantly influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we observe a steady consumption of Adidas products by the U.S. population.
In this context, it is proposed to analyze an offer for women's athletic footwear in outlets such as Walmart or online stores like Amazon, targeting an audience with characteristics similar to those in the Midwest region and during the period identified in this analysis as a sales recession.
